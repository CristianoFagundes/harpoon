This the main README for Harpoon, a flow-level traffic generator.  Harpoon is
now released under terms of the GNU Public License (GPL).  See LICENSE for 
details.

Main documentation for Harpoon is in doc/harpoon_manual.[pdf,html].  Code 
documentation can be generated by running doxygen from the doc subdirectory 
($ doxygen doxygen.cfg).  

A quick build and install guide may be found in INSTALL, but it should not
be used as a substitute for the full documentation.

There are simple management scripts written in Python supplied in the cli 
subdirectory.  Refer to the documentation, the README under the cli subdir,
and to the script code for further information.  There is also a PHP script
for web-based management.  (This script is not yet documented and I'm sure
it's pretty buggy.)  Again, see the documentation for further information.

Harpoon has been tested and is known to work on the following platforms:
 - MacOS X 10.2-10.4
 - Sun Solaris 2.8-2.10
 - Linux 2.2-2.6
 - FreeBSD 5.1-5.4

Any installation will require a working pthreads implementation, libdl (dlopen()
and friends) and the eXpat XML parsing library (expat.sourceforge.net).

We are interested in your experience with Harpoon to improve and maintain 
the tool.  Please send your comments to jsommers (at) cs.wisc.edu.
