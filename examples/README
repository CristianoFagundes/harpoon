There are three config examples in this directory:

1) dummy_plugin.xml
   The dummy plugin doesn't do anything but print a message every few
   seconds.  It exists primarily as an example to show the skeleton of
   a traffic generator plugin.  

2) tcp_client.xml + tcp_server.xml
   A simple TCP client/server pair that communicates over the loopback 
   interface.  The distribution data is totally bogus.  

3) tcp_client_ex2.xml + tcp_server_ex2.xml
   A TCP client/server pair that communicates over the loopback interface,
   but with inter-connection times generated from exponential distribution
   with mean 1 and file sizes generated from pareto distribution with
   alpha=1.2 shape=1500.

4) udp_client.xml + udp_server.xml
   A simple set of UDP pairs for constant bit-rate, ntp-like and dns-like
   sources.  Distribution data is totally made up.

Run each file through the config_validator to see how Harpoon parses the files.
There shouldn't be any surprises.

Refer to the documentation for additional examples and config file details.
